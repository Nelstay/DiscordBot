Hello to whoever may be reading this!

This is my discord bot, it can do the following:

1) Read the messages in your discord chats and respond with set messages and pictures.
2) Gives a random person in your discord server a set role.
3) Checks the time of day and looks to see if it's tiome to take away that role and give it to someone else.
4) Play rock, paper, scissors.

Feel free to change anythin that I have written to fit the needs of your server. Just remember to add your personal bot tokken at the bottom.
